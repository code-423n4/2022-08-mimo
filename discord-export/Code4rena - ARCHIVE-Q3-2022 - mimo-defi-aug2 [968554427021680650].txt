Hey Mimo team, can you point me to an actual implementation of `LendingPool`? It's a bit difficult to verify ideas with the empty mock lending pool functions.


[08/03/2022 9:10 PM] JohnSmith#1623
excuse me, why do we need this?
```
  /// @notice The release version of PRBProxy.
  /// @dev This is stored in the factory rather than the proxy to save gas for end users.
  function VERSION() external view returns (uint256);
```


[08/03/2022 11:26 PM] JohnSmith#1623
Do you think it is something else than https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol ?

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[08/04/2022 12:53 PM] m123#3165
Hi @Django | Saloon Finance there are integration tests running against Aave V3 in a network fork. See https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-mimo/tree/main/test/02_integration

{Reactions}
thankyou (2) 

[08/04/2022 12:55 PM] m123#3165
So yes it should be Pool.sol that @JohnSmith linked


[08/04/2022 12:57 PM] m123#3165
Something that was inherited from the prb-proxy we forked and is just defaulted to 1. Could come in handy if we deploy new contracts that are different from the current ones

I am not so skilled in javascript.   How do I run specific test?


[08/11/2022 1:30 PM] peritoflores
with yarn


[08/11/2022 1:31 PM] illilli000
this contest is closed, but usually it's "yarn test <rel-path-to-test-file>"


[08/11/2022 1:36 PM] peritoflores
thanks @IllIllI .  I know it is closed I am concerned with an issue marked as "disputed".   I believe that there is an error in one of the test
